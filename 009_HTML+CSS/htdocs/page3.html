                    Paid appointments for patients (specialist consultations) are conducted by doctors of various specialties (surgeon, therapist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, etc.). Several doctors may have the same specialty. When registering the appointment, a payment receipt must be generated, which includes information about the patient, the doctor consulting the patient, the cost of the appointment, and the date of the appointment.<br>
                    The patient pays a certain amount for the appointment, which is set individually for each doctor. A fixed percentage of the appointment cost is deducted for the doctor's salary. The percentage of the appointment cost for the doctor's salary is also set individually for each doctor.<br>
                    The salary earned by the doctor for each appointment is calculated using the formula: <b>Cost of the appointment * Percentage deducted for doctor's salary</b>. From this amount, an income tax of 13% is deducted.<br></td>
